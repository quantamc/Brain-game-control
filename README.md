# Brain-game-control

The main objective of BCI technology is tangled within the establishment of new avenues of controlling com- puting devices via biometric systems as opposed to conventional modes such as peripheral devices. This work focuses on this technology particularly the use of brain signals to interpret the neurophysiology signals as direct communication pathway to an external device for a human being. Participants are asked to perform game control tasks in the game to produce brain state information which a number of machine learning models are trained on.The models are compared based on the statistical measures and a more general model developed after this to allow plug and play interactions without a need for training. The 3D game used for control is built in Unity 5 game engine with the traditional navigation controls in the game being mapped to the model predictions and the internal Gyroscope used for panning and rotation. The models are trained on two control states, that is forward and backwards for the character in the game. The results of the work show that EEG-based BCI applications can be applied into real-world applications including medical applications such as the controlling of neuroprosthetics.
